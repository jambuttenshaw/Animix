# Animix

A 3D skeletal animation engine built on top of GEF (Games Education Framework by Abertay University).

Support for blend trees, state machines, animation parameters, ragdoll physics and more.

Unfortunately gef is not publically available, so this software won't build, but I have provided an executable demo in releases. This code is provided here as an example of my work.
